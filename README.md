handlebars-iron
===============

[Handlebars](https://github.com/sunng87/handlebars-rust) middleware
for the [Iron web framework](http://ironframework.io).

[Documentation](https://sunng.info/handlebars-iron/)

Since Rust and its ecosystem are still in very early stage, the
project might been broken for variable reasons. I will try my best to
keep this library compiles with latest Rust nightly before the 1.0
final release. If you find something bad, pull requests and issue reporting
are always welcomed.
