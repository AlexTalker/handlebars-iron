===============

[Handlebars](https://github.com/sunng87/handlebars-rust) middleware
for the [Iron web framework](http://ironframework.io).

Since Rust and its ecosystem are still in early stage, this
project might been broken for various reasons. I will try my best to
keep this library compiles with latest Rust nightly before the 1.0
final release. If you find anything bad, pull requests and issue reporting
are always welcomed.
